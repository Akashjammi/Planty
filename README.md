Planty is an open-sourced project aimed to automatically provide minerals to plants connected to a wastewater reservoir. Clients of these applications are provided with an android application where they get notified when plants are hungry. They are provided to choose between two modes automatic and manual. In case of automatic plants are automatically watered else they will be notified with push notification until they water. The user can add a plant by scanning it through the app the server recognizes the type of plant it is and minerals needed according to weather and moisture content of the soil. The sensor is placed in soil to send values. The app also includes a community between users where they can chat. A simple game-like interface is created to encourage users to play. An e-commerce part is designed to recommend users the fertilizers and extras required for proper growth.
